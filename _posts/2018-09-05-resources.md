## Need a hand?
The most wonderful think about web development is its community. This field is constantly evolving, and its success heavily dependent on working together.


### 1. Issues Board
Your first stop for aid is the <a href="{{ site.git_address | append: "-resources/issues/" }}" target="_blank">GitHub Issues Board</a> for this course. Instructors and students both patrol the threads here, and itâ€™s your best place to get results quickly. Click the &nbsp;<a href="{{ site.git_address | append: "-resources/issues/" }}" target="_blank"><i class="fab fa-github fa-lg" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>&nbsp; icon from the navigation menu above at any time to check-in!


### 2. Zoom
When available, you can send messages or live chat with us at the <a href="{{ site.slack }}" target="_blank">UMMediaArts Slack Channel</a>. Registration is free with your **@umontana.edu** e-mail address. Click the &nbsp;<a href="{{ site.slack }}" target="_blank"><i class="fab fa-slack-hash" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>&nbsp; icon from the navigation menu above at any time to check-in!

We will be using Slack for screen-sharing, meaning we can have direct interaction with your work and can help in real-time remotely. **Please schedule with us via e-mail to set up a live meeting.**


### 3. Self-Help
Never _ever_ hesitate to be your own instructor. There are many resources and communities built precisely for self-guided learning. Here are a few:
- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/)
- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)
- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/)


### 4. E-mail
E-mail should be your last resort, as it may take up to 48 hours for us to respond. Please visit the <a href="{{ site.data.moodle.contact }}" target="_blank">contact area on Moodle<a/> to get current instructor and TA contact information.


### 5. The BA Lab (McGill 127), When Available
<span class="label label-info">Note</span> _The BA Lab is not available every semester. Please check with the department._

Missoula-based students are welcome (and encouraged) to utilize the BA Lab located on the University of Montana main campus. Staffed by graduate candidates and open to all takers of this course, the BA Lab is a one-to-one hands-on resource where you can get help, feedback, or critique before turning assignments in.
