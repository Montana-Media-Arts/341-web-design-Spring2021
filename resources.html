                    <p>Unlike other online courses, it is vital that we create a connection. As such, I would like to set up weekly "chats" with each of you to make sure you are doing okay. It's important that you feel like you can ask questions, work with
                        me directly and get the help you need in a timely fashion. Please feel free to schedule a meeting with me each week by using this link. Please note that if you don't hvae anything to discuss specifically an email will suffice.
                        However, I want to be as available as possible. <a href="https://calendly.com/michael-cassens/341-meeting" target="_new">Calendly Link</a></p>
