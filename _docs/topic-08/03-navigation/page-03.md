<div class="divider-heading"></div>

We've been discussing external and internal linking for several topics now, so this should be review. Utilizing the “dot method” to navigate from page-to-page may take practice, however.


<p><span class="remember-text">Remember?</span><br/>
<a href="../../topic-04/nav-links/" target="_new">Page-to-page</a> navigation may require going into/out-of child directories. Page URLs reflect the folders they are in, and must be considered when creating links to-and-from these pages.</p>


<div class="external-embed">
  <p data-height="600" data-theme-id="30567" data-slug-hash="pobJgJv" data-default-tab="html,result" data-user="retrog4m3r" data-pen-title="HTML Nav Element, Site Navigation" class="codepen"></p>
</div>


<span class="label label-danger">Important</span> You will have to add the `<nav>` element to **every page** of the site, and this means your relative links may need to change, as you jump in-and-out of child directories. _Always test your links!_
