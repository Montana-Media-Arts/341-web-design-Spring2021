<div class="divider-heading"></div>

Any site with a respectable amount of content needs to have reliable site navigation. In this site, for example, the main navigation is divided as such:
- A logo and site title that link back to the home.
- Links to site pages, including a dropdown menu to modules.
- Icons to outside resources.

<img src="../img/site-nav-example.gif" alt="blocks of the site navigation bar" title="Site Navigation" />

This navigation is available at all times while browsing the site. The _section navigation_ to the left however, only populates pages relative to its module, and is unavailable otherwise.

For your Instructable, you should consider two types of navigation:
1. Site Navigation (set of links to pages on the site)
2. Page Navigation (jumping to sections of long pages using `href` and `id` elements)

Let's start by looking at the **&lt;nav&gt; element**, which will help you stay organized when structuring pages.
