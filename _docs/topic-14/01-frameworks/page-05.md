<div class="divider-heading"></div>


Another contender in the race is Semantic UI, which tries to distinguish itself with a lot of themes and customization. There are more than 3000 theming variables, which results in a massive breadth. Or so the docs say.




Bootstrap 4 kind of covers all this and is fully customizable as well, but one advantage with Semantic UI is that it results in nice-looking layouts by default. Still, it’s not the best-looking out of the box, which is why I put it later down on my list.

It also has one of the steepest learning curves, and coding conventions are much more strict. Try it; I’d say, and see if it looks like something you might prefer.
