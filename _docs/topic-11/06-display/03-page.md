<div class="divider-heading"></div>

In the following example, notice that the same basic HTML code is used three times in a row. However, the second and third examples have `display: inline;` & `display: inline-block;`, respectively.

Notice the differences of these display techniques. Particularly with regard to horizontal and vertical spacing.

<div class="codepen-embed">
  <p data-height="600" data-theme-id="30567" data-slug-hash="XWKEvvP" data-default-tab="css,result" data-user="retrog4m3r" data-embed-version="2" data-pen-title="[Topic-09] Display, Pt. 2" class="codepen"></p>
</div>


As you can see, we have used `display: inline;` & `display: inline-block;` to create our first header menus! And in fact, it is often used for that purpose. (More on that later...)
