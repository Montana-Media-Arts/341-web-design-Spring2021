The next property to explore as we learn how to build layouts is position (`position: `).

The position property allows developers to specify how elements are positioned in the browser window.

#### Box Offset Properties

The `position:` property sets the type of "layout flow" elements will follow. When set to a value that allows for the relative or specific positioning of elements, developers can use the following "box offset properties" to set those positions;

- `top: `
- `bottom: `
- `left: `
- `right: `

Depending on the value of the `position: ` property, these will act in different ways. However, they basic function serves to set the position of an element, through either relative units (i.e. `em`, `%`) or absolute units (i.e. `px`).
