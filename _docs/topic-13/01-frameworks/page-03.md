<a href="https://bulma.io/" target="_new">Bulma</a> is a relatively new entrant to the battleground of CSS frameworks and has made a name for itself in a short time. Its attractiveness lies in a strict, CSS-only approach (there are no JavaScript components), and elegant defaults, which is something many developers with a good eye for design have a problem with when working with Bootstrap.

Much of the momentum of Bulma comes from high rates of adoption with the Laravel (a PHP web framework, in case you didn’t know) community, which I’m sure is pretty much what helped Vue.js rise to the heights of popularity among JavaScript frameworks.

**Why choose the Bulma CSS Framework**

There are many reasons to like Bulma and use it for your next project:

**Quite popular:** Okay, it’s not more popular than Bootstrap, but it is more popular than Foundation. As of writing, Bulma has 30k+ stars on Github, around 3k+ more than Foundations. Of course, a number of Github stars is no metric of merit, but it does say that the community approves of Bulma.
Extremely readable classes: Bulma, for me, has the most readable CSS classes of all the frameworks I’ve tried. There’s also a ridiculously powerful and simple system for creating Metro-style grids, called tiles (just look at the code in the second-half of the screenshot, and tell me you’re not impressed!).
Flat learning curve: Bulma is highly modular and was created to solve the practical, everyday problems that smaller teams and individual developers come across. You’ll find that Bulma is very easy to learn, though I think that a decent background in CSS is always good to have an idea of what might be going on under the hood. This will help you when you want to override the default behavior.

**Elegant:** Well, take a look at the default Hero section for Bulma below.

Bulma has a small, but an extremely passionate community, so if you want to do away with all the fluff and yet want to come up with elegant-looking UIs in record time, Bulma is the way to go. For Bootstrap developers, Bulma has a separate section to convince and help them migrate over.
