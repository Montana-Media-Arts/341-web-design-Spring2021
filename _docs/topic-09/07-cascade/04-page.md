<div class="divider-heading"></div>

If a developer believes it is necessary to **force** a rule, and is worried about it being overwritten, they can append the keyword `!important` after the CSS property value. This tells the browser to give precedence to this rule.

<span class="label label-info">NOTE:</span> Be careful using the `!important` keyword, as it can cause you to forget why a rule is not working when otherwise it should be. Often times, it is the use of important in another rule.
