<div class="divider-heading"></div>

Not all properties will inherit their value from the parent element.

Text properties tend to inherit values from their parents; however, some properties do not. As with many things in web development, this is partly browser-specific.


### Forcing Inheritance

If you are worried, or find a property that is not inheriting, you can force inheritance with the `inherit` keyword as the properties value.


<div class="codepen-embed">
  <p data-height="400" data-theme-id="30567" data-slug-hash="EwMNeM" data-default-tab="css,result" data-user="Media-Ed-Online" data-embed-version="2" data-pen-title="[Topic-07] Inheritance, Pt. 2" class="codepen"></p>
</div>
