<div class="divider-heading"></div>

The **element selector** is used to select all elements of a certain type. This selector is applied by simply using an element name (the reserved keyword placed in the opening tag of an element).

So to select all level 2 headings we write `h2`. Then we could turn their text blue and make them quite large with style rules in the declaration block.

<span class="label label-info">NOTE:</span> This is the selector type that has been demonstrated the most so far in the last few pages.
