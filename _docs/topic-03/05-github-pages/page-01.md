Okay, it's time for our first HTML coding experience and subsequent page. Writing it is only half the battle - we also need to figure out how to get it on the internet for others to view.

We are going to need to acquire **server space**. This space is where we will store our files. Furthermore, this server will actually "serve" these files to requesting host-computers. In addition to acquiring a server, we will need to each get individual and unique URLs to where we can point a computer.

This is where <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub Pages</a> really comes into play:
<ul class="pros-and-cons">
  <li class="icon-pro">...providing free storage and hosting.</li>
  <li class="icon-pro">...providing a free domain.</li>
  <li class="icon-pro">...providing avenues for testing and sharing solutions between student and instructor.</li>
</ul>

## What is GitHub Pages?
[GitHub.com](https://github.com) provides free web hosting for static websites (a static site is one that does not involve server-side computational work beyond serving or delivering files to a requesting host-computer). Using GitHub Pages becomes our server, and they will also provide us with URLs!

GitHub assigns each user the following URL:
_username.github.io_

The following is your _baseurl_. You will "attach" paths to further child directories and files to the end of this basurl. For example, `https://michaelcassens.github.io/MART341-WebDesign/assignment-4/`
