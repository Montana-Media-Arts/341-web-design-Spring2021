The **body element** is a container for all of the content and data intended for display on the browser's page.

If you want visitors to see or have access to an element, it will nearly always be inside the `<body>`. In our analogy, we can say that the `<body>` is the physical "body" of the site in which visitors meet, see, and interact with different elements.

<div class="code-heading">
  <span class="html">HTML</span>
</div>
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title></title>
  </head>

  <body>
    <!-- “My Way-Cool Awesome Site!” contents, visible to visitors. -->
  </body>
</html>
```
