<div class="divider-heading"></div>


The **document type element** is the first element in an HTML document and should be placed on the _first line_. This element tells the browser's processor what type of HTML document it is.

The `<!DOCTYPE>` declaration is not an HTML tag; it is an instruction to the web browser indicating the HTML page's version.

<div class="code-heading">
  <span class="html">HTML</span>
</div>
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>

```
