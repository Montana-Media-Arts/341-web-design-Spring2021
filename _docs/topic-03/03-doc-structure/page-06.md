Can you see how a single page is similar to how you're structured? **You only have one head and one body, and the head _always_ comes first.**

<img src="../img/person-doc-structure.jpg" alt="stick figure representing head and body of an HTML document" title="Just like an HTML doc!" />


<div class="divider-pg"></div>


The following is the basic layout of an HTML document.

<div class="code-heading">
  <span class="html">HTML</span>
</div>
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title></title>
    <!-- Meta data and information about your site, not visible to visitors. -->
  </head>

  <body>
    <!-- “My Way-Cool Awesome Site!” contents, visible to visitors. -->
  </body>
</html>
```
