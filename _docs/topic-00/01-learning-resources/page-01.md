The learning management system for this course will be [Moodle]({{site.data.moodle.main}}).

There, you will turn in and receive grades for all submitted work, including assignments, quizzes, and projects. Homework is a community-affair, and you are encouraged to view each other's submissions.

<span class="label label-danger">Important</span> This **_does not_** mean "copy each other's work." You should explore others' processes, but only use it for problem solving or ideation.
