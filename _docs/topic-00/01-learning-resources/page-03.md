## Technologies
You are expected to utilize three main applications for this course:
1. <a href="https://atom.io/" target="_blank">Atom Text Editor</a> - Atom is a free versatile text editor.
2. <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download" target="_new">Visual Studio Code</a> is another free HTML editor that is quite useful as well.
3. There are many others that you are more than welcome to use.  
4. <a href="https://desktop.github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub Desktop App</a> - We recommend this free GUI-based front-end application for connecting your GitHub account remotely.  This should be a review from Creative Coding 1.  _Other options: Terminal (MAC), Command Line or PowerShell (PC), SourceTree, etc._
5. Most Up-to-Date Browser - You should have at least one current version of [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/), [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/), and/or [Safari](https://www.apple.com/safari/) and [Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/microsoft-edge) are difficult to learn web development on, so you should utilize one of the other browsers for the remainder of this course.
