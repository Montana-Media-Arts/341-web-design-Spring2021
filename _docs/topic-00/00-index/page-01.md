## About
Coding. Learning. Engagement. Great websites.

Hopefully, this won't be completely brand new.  In Creative Coding 1, we briefly covered HTML, CSS and JavaScript.  This was done with intention so that you would have some knowledge before taking this class.  Don't worry though, we are going through everything again just in case you forgot anything!

This course will ask you to learn and adapt to new technologies, while also thinking about design and content creation. By its end, you should feel comfortable making websites from the ground-up, and utilizing your peers as learning tools in this creative community.

## Pace
Some topics will lean more technical in nature, while others (albeit fewer) will be more design-based. Just as the content focus will shift, so too will the work amount. Some topics, especially those where new ideas are being introduced, have a heavier workload. The goal of this is to make you practice with these new technologies and techniques, while other areas will slow down and allow you to tinker at a more exploratory pace.

## Goals
The main goal of this course is to allow you an opportunity to become comfortable with technologies used in web development. Another is to get you thinking about web design and possibilities for content creation via the web.
