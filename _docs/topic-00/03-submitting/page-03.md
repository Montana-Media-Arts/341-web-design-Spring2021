The absolute best way to ask for help in this course is to utilize the <a href="{{ site.git_address }}-resources/issues/">Issues board</a> feature. This is ideal because:

1. Everyone has access to your question, and can help respond.
2. It is easier for your instructor to reply to Issues than to e-mails.
3. If you push changes to GitHub, your instructor has access to your code and can provide _specific_ solutions, when/where/how directly into your site code.


## Contributing
As the semester goes on you will be expected to open issues when you are having problems.
