To complete this area of the course, you’ll need to have registered for a free GitHub account.

We will discuss <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub.com</a> more in the future, but in the meantime, I would you like you to know that GitHub is a web service which is used for storing git repositories by developers. Much of that statement is still likely jargon to you, and that’s okay - it will all come in time.


## Create a GitHub.com Account
To begin, you need to register with <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub.com</a>.

<span class="label label-info">Note</span> Please choose a username that you are comfortable with being part of your publicly-visible URL. It's up to you, but I recommend making it something that you are okay sharing with others.  This is a common question from perspective employers.  They want a link to your GitHub repository and if it's something silly, you might not want to share it.  Here are some examples.

<ul class="pros-and-cons">
  <li class="icon-pro">michaelcassens</li>
  <li class="icon-pro">mcassens</li>
  <li class="icon-pro">cassens-mt</li>
  <li class="icon-con">crazyrider456</li>
  <li class="icon-con">dzjewqs</li>
</ul>

Your username will be publicly available and used often for many things throughout this course (ie. homework) and your entire time on GitHub.
