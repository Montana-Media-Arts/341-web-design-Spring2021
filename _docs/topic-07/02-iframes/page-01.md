<div class="divider-heading"></div>

When a developer needs to include content from an external source or a separate external website on their own site, they can use **iframes**. The `<iframe>` element can be thought of as a window, with a view onto another webpage or part of another webpage.

The 3 attributes an image element should include are:

1. The tags themselves.
2. The source attribute (location of the content, page, file, etc).
3. Width and height values.
