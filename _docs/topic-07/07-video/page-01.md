There are two ways to approach adding video to your site: self-hosted (within your own directory and repository), or via a video-sharing service, like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/" target="_new">YouTube</a> or <a href="https://vimeo.com/" target="_new">Vimeo</a>.


## Self-Hosted Video

The `<video>` element allows developers to add a video player to webpages. This is a new element to HTML5, and offers three supported video formats: .mp4, .webm, and .ogg.

The **video element** can be used to add a self-hosted video file to your site, and allows for both single-instances and fallback files to be referenced in the element.


## Service-Hosted Video

To embed a video from a video-sharing service, use their provided embed code, which often utilizes the `<iframe>` element discussed previously in this Topic.

The following is an example for <a href="https://youtube.com" target="_new">YouTube</a>:
