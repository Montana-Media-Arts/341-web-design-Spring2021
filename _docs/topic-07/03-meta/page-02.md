<div class="divider-heading"></div>

One metadata use that you should be familiar with is the **charset** declaration. This informs the browser of the “**character set**” encoding of the document (i.e. the character set that matches the binary data).

You should always include the metadata charset line in your head element of your html documents.


<div class="code-heading">
  <span class="html">HTML</span>
</div>
```html
<meta charset="UTF-8">
```
