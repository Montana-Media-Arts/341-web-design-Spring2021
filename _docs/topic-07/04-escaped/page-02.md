There are two ways of including an escape character in your HTML text. The first, mentioned on the next page, simply utilizes the decimal-based character code. This of course can be difficult to remember for the characters you may need.

**Escape names** often have special codes that are more “human readable,” known as entity names. The less-than and greater-than characters (`<` and `>`) are escaped quite often in web design, and have entity names “lt” and “gt,” respectively.

Not many characters have entity names. To use an entity name, begin with an ampersand (`&`), add the entity name, and finish with a semicolon (`;`). In fact, to use the ampersand (&) we would write the escape character name as `&amp;`.
