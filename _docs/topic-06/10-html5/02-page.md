<div class="divider-heading"></div>

It is possible to use HTML5 to inform users if they have entered information correctly. This is known as “**form validation**”.

Traditionally, form validation occurs with JavaScript, but HTML5 includes these features.

Validation helps ensure the user enters information correctly and with the correct "types" of data. Validation before submitting a form helps reduce resource usage on a server and enables users to more quickly see if there are errors in their form.

An example of form validation is the `required` attribute. Try pressing the 'Submit' button before entering any text:


<div class="codepen-embed">
  <p data-height="300" data-theme-id="30567" data-slug-hash="abNMaod" data-default-tab="html,result" data-user="retrog4m3r" data-embed-version="2" data-pen-title="HTML5 Validation" class="codepen"></p>
</div>


<span class="label label-info">NOTE:</span> This type of validation may not be supported on all browsers (i.e. Safari), so it may be necessary to include other types of form validation (for example - JavaScript).
