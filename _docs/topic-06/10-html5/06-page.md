HTML5 also introduced the “figure” (`<figure>`) and “figure caption” (`<figcaption>`) elements further assist with images. These can be used together to easily group figures or images with associated captions.

The **figure element** is the container which groups together one or more images with a caption. Within the figure element, one places an image and/or related elements, as well as your caption elements.
