<div class="divider-heading"></div>

The **submit** button sends a form to a server. This is the _one_ form type that **does not** require a name attribute.  However, you still need an `id` attribute.

The `value=""` attribute is used to specify the text that appears on the button. It is good practice to always specify this, as opposed to allowing the browser to use its default "submit" text.

The appearance of submit buttons is dictated by individual browsers. However, these can be styled using CSS.


<div class="codepen-embed">
  <p data-height="400" data-theme-id="30567" data-slug-hash="dyMrzKm" data-default-tab="html,result" data-user="retrog4m3r" data-embed-version="2" data-pen-title="Submit Button" class="codepen"></p>
</div>
