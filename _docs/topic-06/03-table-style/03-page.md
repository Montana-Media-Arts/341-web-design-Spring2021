<div class="divider-heading"></div>

You may wish to "cushion" your cell contents from their borders. We do this using the `padding=""` property. Generally, we measure this **padding** in pixels, and again, this is something we'll eventually do with CSS.

<div class="code-heading">
  <span class="html">HTML</span>
</div>
```html
<style>
    table, th, td {
      border: 1px solid black;
      padding: 5px;
    }
</style>
```
