You may have heard about Responsive Web Design (RWD) before, but what is it?

<blockquote>
  <p><b>Responsive Web Design</b> <i>is about using HTML and CSS to automatically resize, hide, shrink, or enlarge, a website, to make it look good on all devices (desktops, tablets, and phones)...[because] a web page should look good on</i> <b>any</b> <i>device!</i></p>
  <p>- <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_responsive.asp">W3Schools</a></p>
</blockquote>

It encompasses a few critical ideas. First and foremost, a web page should look good, and be easy to use, regardless of the device. RWD is also a design strategy that emphasizes “mobile first, with unobtrusive javascript, and progressive enhancement”. This is especially pertinent in current design, as the amount of mobile traffic now accounts for more than half of total internet traffic.

## Sites on Mobile
There are many ways of developing a responsive site. There is not necessarily a “correct” solution.
