<div class="divider-heading"></div>

As with anything included in your site, the files must be organized in a set directory structure.

<div style="display: inline-block; width: 100%;">
<p><img src="../img/directory-fonts-folder.jpg" style="float: right; width: 350px; margin: 10px 0 10px 10px; border: none" />Font files should be placed in a child-directory, labeled something along the lines of <code>/fonts</code>.</p>

<p>To use these fonts we would include an <code>@font-face</code> for <i>each</i> font (as we did in the previous pages), along with relative URLs for each font type. This allows us to ensure compatibility with all browsers.</p>
</div>
