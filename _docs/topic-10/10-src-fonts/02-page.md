<a href="https://fonts.google.com" target="_new">Google Fonts</a> is one of the premiere font libraries, so our tutorial will focus on their service. But you should explore other options as well, as there may be different font selections to choose from.

We have 3 options on how we can get fonts from Google Fonts:
- Option A: By downloading the files and using CSS and @font-face declarations.
- Option B: By embedding and linking in HTML via the "Standard" method, good for single-page sites.
- Option C: By embedding and linking in CSS via the "@import" method, good for multi-page sites.
