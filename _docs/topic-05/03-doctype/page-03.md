<div class="divider-heading"></div>

You might expect the DOCTYPE declaring “this document is written in HTML5” would have the number five in it somewhere. It doesn’t. The doctype for HTML5 looks like this:


<div class="code-heading">
  <span class="html">HTML</span>
</div>
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>

```


<span class="label label-danger">Important</span> The DOCTYPE declaration should be the **first** thing in your HTML file; on line 1.
