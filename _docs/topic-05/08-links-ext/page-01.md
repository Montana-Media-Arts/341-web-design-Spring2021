One of the primary reasons for the Internet was to easily reference research when citing others, with an ability to directly “link” to their work.


## Hyperlink
In computing, a **hyperlink**, or merely a link, refers to data that the reader can directly follow either by clicking, tapping, or hovering. A hyperlink points to a whole document or a specific element within a document.


## Hypertext
**Hypertext** is text with hyperlinks. The text that is linked is called _anchor text_. A user following hyperlinks is said to navigate or browse the hypertext. [<sup>\[1]</sup>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink "Wikipedia - Hyperlink")

<span class="label label-info">Note</span> Link text should be specific about where the user will be going if they click a link. This specificity means that links **should not** be simple text such as “Click Me!” Instead, a best practice would dictate that the link text be a description of the site, name, or information that informs the user.
