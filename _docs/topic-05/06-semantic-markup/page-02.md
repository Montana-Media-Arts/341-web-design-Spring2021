Just like bold, another widespread semantic alteration is the use of _italicized text_. Text can be marked up as italicized by using the **italic element**, `<i>...</i>`.

As with bold/strong, the italicized text does not necessarily imply a semantically different meaning. Instead, you are encouraged to use the _"emphasis"_ element instead ( `<em>...</em>` ). The **emphasis** element indicates subtle changes in the meaning of a sentence. By default, the browser will show these elements in italic.


<div class="code-heading">
  <span class="html">HTML</span>
</div>
```html
<p>This is an element is in <i>italics</i>, and will appear slanted.</p>

<p>This is an element is <em>emphasized</em>, and will also appear slanted.</p>
```
