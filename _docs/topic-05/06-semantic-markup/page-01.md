<div class="divider-heading"></div>

One of the most common types of semantic markup is to “bold” some text via the **bold element**. The element used for identifying bold text is `<b>...</b>`.

However, it is important to recognize that bold text does not imply any extra meaning. For this reason, you are encouraged to use the **strong element**. The use of a strong element ( `<strong>...</strong>` ) indicates that its content has strong importance. By default, browsers will show the contents of strong elements in bold.


<div class="code-heading">
  <span class="html">HTML</span>
</div>
```html
<p>This is a <b>bold</b> element.</p>

<p>This is a <strong>strong</strong> element.</p>
```
