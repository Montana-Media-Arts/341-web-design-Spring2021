<div class="divider-heading"></div>

The **title** tag defines the title of a document. This action:

- describes a title in the browser toolbar.
- provides a title for the page when it added to favorites.
- displays a title for the page in search engine results.

You cannot have more than one title element. However, you _must_ have the title element for the document to validate as HTML.

<span class="label label-danger">Important</span> **This is the only required element in the head.**


<div class="code-heading">
  <span class="html">HTML</span>
</div>
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <!-- Other meta elements -->
    <title>My Way-Cool Awesome Site</title>

  </head>

</html>
```



  <p><span class="remember-text">Remember?</span><br/>
  The <i>title</i> tag aptly contains your site's or page's title, and shows up on the browser's tabs.</p>
