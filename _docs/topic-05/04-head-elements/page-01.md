<div class="divider-heading"></div>

We can consider several elements as required in the **head element**, and others that you are _encouraged_ to include. These elements tell the browser and processor information about the HTML document, such as the title, author, and publication date.

The <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> element is a container for processing information and document metadata. The <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> contains high-level information about the site, and always comes first within the root element. In this sense, we can consider the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> to contain the thoughts of the page.


<div class="code-heading">
  <span class="html">HTML</span>
</div>
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <!-- Meta data and information about your site, not visible to visitors. -->
  </head>

</html>
```


The following pages provide you a proper order of placement of elements within the `<head>`; however, there is no strict documentation on this order.
