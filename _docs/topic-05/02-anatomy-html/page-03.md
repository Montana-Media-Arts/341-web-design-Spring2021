<div class="divider-heading"></div>

A very common first attribute **value** located on a webpage is in the _root element_ (`<html>...</html>`), in terms of an [ISO language code](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_language_codes.asp) and/or [ISO country code](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_country_codes.asp).

For example, I may want my site indexed as containing content written in "US-style English:"


<div class="code-heading">
  <span class="html">HTML</span>
</div>
```html
<html lang="en-US">
  <p>The root element is made with "<html>" tags, with the key="value" pair of lang="en-US".
  <br />
  This root attribute states the page is written in US-style English.</p>
</html>
```


The HTML lang attribute declares the language of a Web page or a portion of a Web page. This attribute assists search engines and browsers.
