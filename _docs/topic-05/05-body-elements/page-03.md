<div class="divider-heading"></div>

  <p><b>Semantic markup</b> us used to reinforce the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantics" taget="_blank">semantics</a> - or meaning - of the information in a document. Semantic markup might be used to place <em>emphasis</em> on a word or phrase, or identify a word as being <strong>strong</strong>. They can also provide <cite>citations</cite> or <q>quotations</q>, link to <dfn title="a statement of the exact meaning of a word">definitions</dfn>, or distinguish <del>editorial changes</del>.</p>
</div>

<p>For example:</p>

<blockquote>“Known as <cite>Clue</cite> in North America, <cite>Cleudo</cite> is a murder-mystery game based on <b>strategy</b> and <b>deduction.</b> Players make arguments based on their questioning of the <u>perpetrator</u>, <u>location</u>, and <u>method</u> of the crime.”</blockquote>


<div class="code-heading">
  <span class="html">HTML</span>
</div>
```html
<blockquote>“Known as <cite>Clue</cite> in North America, <cite>Cleudo</cite> is a murder-mystery game based on <b>strategy</b> and <b>deduction.</b> Players make arguments based on their questioning of the <u>perpetrator</u>, <u>location</u>, and <u>method</u> of the crime.”</blockquote>
```


We can use this pattern in HTML using text, tags, and markup to create arguments for our content and its meaning.
