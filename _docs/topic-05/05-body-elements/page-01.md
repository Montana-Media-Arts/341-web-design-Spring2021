The <b>body element</b> is where all of the “meat & potatoes” (if you will) of the site gets placed. This is the data that is rendered by the browser and displayed on the client's local computer.</p>


<div class="code-heading">
  <span class="html">HTML</span>
</div>
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <!-- Meta data and information about your site, not visible to visitors. -->
    <title>My Way-Cool Awesome Site!</title>
  </head>

  <body>
    <!-- My “Way-Cool Awesome Site” contents, visible to visitors. -->
  </body>
</html>
```


Within the body, there will generally be two types of markup used:

1. Structural markup
2. Semantic markup
