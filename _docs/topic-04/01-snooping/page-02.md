There is too much information for any one person to know right away in development and coding. Another tool you can use when getting started is “**inspect element**,” or inspecting the site's current DOM tree state. This way of snooping shows the code _normalized_ by the browser, which has its pros and cons:

<ul class="pros-and-cons">
  <li class="icon-pro">Complete view; shows everything dictating the page.</li>
  <li class="icon-pro">Shows code in a “corrected state,” adding missing tags, or fixing invalid code.</li>
  <li class="icon-con">Can be complex, and requires higher-level understanding of web languages to navigate.</li>
</ul>


## Chrome
In <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/" target="_blank">Chrome</a>:
