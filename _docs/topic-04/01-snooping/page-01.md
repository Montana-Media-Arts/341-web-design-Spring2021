A great way to learn website development is to see it in action. All internet browsers allow viewing of a site's core code allowing visitors to explore how other developers make their sites.

One invaluable way of doing this is “**view-source**,” or viewing the site's source code. This way of snooping shows the code _exactly_ as it was delivered from the server to the browser, which has its pros and cons:

<ul class="pros-and-cons">
  <li class="icon-pro">Quick and easy view; legible and exact.</li>
  <li class="icon-pro">May “catch” invalid code, and show what needs correcting.</li>
  <li class="icon-con">Does not show how the DOM <i>actually</i> built the page.</li>
</ul>
