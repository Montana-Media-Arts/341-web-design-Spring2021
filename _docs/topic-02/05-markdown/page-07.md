You may wish to ask for help with code that isn't working. To add **inline code** within a sentence using Markdown (like `width=20`), wrap it in single back-tick characters.

Large amounts of code should go in **code blocks**. In Markdown, code blocks are created by “fencing” code with three back-ticks above and below, and delineating its language on the top row.

On most American keyboards, the back-tick is the leftmost key on number line, below esc.
