**Paragraphs** contain sentences of related information. In Markdown, paragraphs are created using empty lines above and below the paragraph text. A single return within the paragraph text _will not_ create a new paragraph.

<div class="code-heading">
  <span class="md">Markdown</span>
</div>
```markdown
I am a paragraph. I should contain several sentences that expand on a central point or idea. If I wish to create another paragraph, I must have an empty line between myself and the beginning of the next sentence set.

I am another paragraph.
A single return does not break me.

An empty line is needed between us to fully-create another paragraph.
```
