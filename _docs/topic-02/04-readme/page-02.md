Despite how it sounds, Mark<u>down</u> is actually a mark<u>up</u> language! A **markup language** is a system for annotating a document in a way that is syntactically distinguishable from the text. Markup languages tend to encourage writers to focus on _content_ and _structure_ before concerning themselves with presentation.

Structure is defined for a processor through the use of tags embedded directly in the text.

You learned about Markdown and [Markdown files](../../topic-01/markdown-files) last topic, but let's look at another example:

<div class="code-heading">
  <span class="md">Markdown</span>
</div>
```markdown
A **markup language** is a system for annotating a document in a way that is syntactically distinguishable from the text. Markup languages tend to encourage writers to focus on *content* and *structure* before concerning themselves with presentation.
```

You can see that in order to make text **bold**, I need to wrap it in double asterisks:  `**bold**`. *Italic* text is wrapped in single asterisks: `*italic*`.
