Like we've talked about, **README files** are text-based files used in documentation. Files ending in a `.md` file extension are Markdown files, so a `README.md` is a README file written in Markdown.

Here's a good reference guide:
- _What_ - A README explains the contents of a directory.
- _When_ - A README should be the _first_ file you create!
- _Where_ - A README should be top-level (inside the “main” folder).

Services such as <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub</a> and <a href="https://bitbucket.org/" target="_blank">Bitbucket</a> actually “look” for these files and render them automatically, so it's important to create these files thoughtfully.

<h2 id="readme-ideas">Assignment Reports</h2>
Every repository you make for this class will have a `README.md` file. We initiated our **MART341-WebDesign/** root repository with a `README.md` file, but all homework repositories will need to have `README.md` files created for them.

**For every assignment you submit, you will also write a short report in a text file.** This report is the `README.md` for that directory, and may discuss a number of things every week:

- Questions regarding your understanding of the Topic's materials.
- Summarizing the work you did this cycle, paying particular attention to the individual choices you made.
- Is there anything in particular you learned that you would like to discuss further?
- What problems did you have? How did you solve them?
