<div class="divider-heading"></div>


An **absolute URL** contains all of the protocols and information for the file's location. If I am the owner of **www.another-example.com** and I want to link to your _profile.png_ image on **www.example.com**, I will need its absolute URL because it lives on a separate site than mine.

Referring to [your directory](../urls-addresses#dir) on the previous page, this is the absolute URL of that file:

<div style="padding: 20px 0px 80px 0px;">
  <p align="center">
    <img src="../img/url-file.png" alt="graphic of a person smiling" title="Profile" style="width: 200px" />
  </p>
  <p class="url-example">http://www.example.com/content/images/profile.png</p>
</div>

We can compare this to me needing to know the city, street, building, and apartment number of your _profile.png_ because I live in a different city.

<img src="../img/url-building.gif" alt="apartment building" style="width: 400px;" />
<div class="img-caption">I'm coming from the city of another-example.com, so I need the full address to any files in example.com!</div>
