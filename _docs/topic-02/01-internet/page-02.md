    <p>Web development is not necessarily <i>web design</i>, although web design is an aspect of development. Web design is focused on creating the aesthetic feel/look, user experience, and flow of content (although the last of these could actually be considered <i>content development</i>).</p>

    <p>Web design is a critical part of web development and we will spend some time discussing user experience design (UX), layout and flow, modern design elements, and content creation. These ideas will be discussed within the presentation of techniques and technology. The reason for this is to start creating a gestalt between your creative ideas and technical abilities.</p>
