**README files** are text files that contain information about their directory. They explain why the project is useful, what kinds of files it may have, its history, or any other relevant points worth elaborating.

<a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub.com</a> uses **Markdown** extensively within its ecosystem for documentation; README files and Issues postings are written using Markdown.


## Files and Directories
Placing the `README.md` file the repository's root directory, results in GitHub recognizing and automatically displaying the README to repository visitors - meaning it's the first thing they'll see, with no extra clicking.

<div class="code-heading">
  <span>Directory Tree</span>
</div>
<pre id="bash">
.
└── <i class="far fa-folder-open"></i> assignment-02/
    └── <i class="far fa-file-alt"></i> README.md

</pre>

Don't worry if this doesn't quite make sense yet: we can provide an example! Go ahead, <a href="{{ site.git_address }}#readme" target="_blank">check ours out</a>.
